## README for Emotion Detection Project

Thank you for your interest in the Emotion Detection project! This README file provides an overview of the project and instructions for installation, usage, and contributing.

## Project Overview

The Emotion Detection project aims to classify emotions on a person's face into one of seven categories using deep convolutional neural networks. The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset, which consists of grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with seven emotions: angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad, and surprised.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle. It contains two main folders: 'train' and 'test'. Within each of these folders, there are seven subfolders, each representing a different emotion. The dataset consists of grayscale, 48x48 sized face images.

## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone the project repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/A-iLaa/Emotion-Detection-Using-Cnn.git
Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
